[@a11yisimportant](https://twitter.com/a11yisimportant) is a Twitter bot which follows smart people tweeting about #a11y and retweets mentions. Written in Typescript and hosted on [Oswald Labs Platform](https://oswaldlabs.com/platform/).

## ‚≠ê How it works

#### `/follow`

The follow endpoint follows users tweeting with the hashtag #a11y. It runs every hour, powered by [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) and a webhook:

1. Find (mixed) tweets with hashtag #a11y
1. Like all those tweets
1. Make a list of users (unique)
1. Remove any users @a11yisimportant already follows
1. Follow everyone from this list

#### `/retweet`

The retweet endpoint retweets tweets that @a11yisimportant is tagged in. It runs every hour, powered by [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) and a webhook:

1. Find (recent) tweets with mention @a11yisimportant
1. Remove any tweets written by self
1. Remove any tweets which are already retweeted
1. Like every tweet in this list
1. If this tweet is a reply, get the original tweet instead
1. Remove any duplicates (unique array)
1. Remove any "Thanks for the follow!" tweets
1. Retweet every tweet in this list

#### Interfaces

This package also exposes the following Typescript interfaces:

- `SearchResult` for the result from a standard search using the Twitter API
- `SearchMeta` for the metadata in a search result
- `User` for a user's profile
- `Tweet` for a tweet object

You can use them like this:

```js
import { Tweet } from "a11yisimportant/interfaces" 
const tweet: Tweet = {
  id_str: "1106516296085188609",
  text: "Accessibility is important",
  user: {
    id_str: "1106514269758214144",
    screen_name: "a11yisimportant"
  }
  // . . .
};
```

In each interface, longint strings are preferred since JavaScript natively doesn't support such large integers (e.g., `id_str` instead of `id`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
